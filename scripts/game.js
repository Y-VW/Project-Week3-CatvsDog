// need to write a game class with a function to start the game, to restart (play again), collision
// need to check how to write whose turn it is, need to check how to check who wins and how it restarts
// bonus function could be: wind direction that changes, health bars instead of health in numbers, different players levels (beginner, advanced, etc), time within throw should be performed
